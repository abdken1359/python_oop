Glad it makes sense now! You're moving towards an **intermediate level** in Python Turtle, so let's explore some more advanced and fun methods that can help you take your drawings to the next level.

Here are some **intermediate-level Turtle methods** and concepts that you might find useful:

---

### 1. **`t1.setheading(angle)`**

This sets the direction of the turtle to the specified angle. It’s similar to turning, but instead of relative turns (like `left()` or `right()`), you set the turtle’s heading to an absolute angle.

```python
t1.setheading(90)  # Point the turtle upwards (90 degrees)
```

---

### 2. **`t1.goto(x, y)`** (Absolute Position)

Moves the turtle directly to the **(x, y)** coordinates on the screen.

```python
t1.goto(100, 150)  # Moves the turtle to the position (100, 150)
```

---

### 3. **`t1.setposition(x, y)`** (Same as `goto`)

This is essentially another way to set the turtle’s position, and it works the same as `goto()`. It's just another way to write it.

```python
t1.setposition(-200, -100)  # Move the turtle to (-200, -100)
```

---

### 4. **`t1.circle(radius, extent=None, steps=None)`**

This method is a more flexible way of drawing circles. The **`extent`** parameter specifies how far around the circle to draw (in degrees), and the **`steps`** parameter can be used to approximate a circle with a polygon (useful for things like making a star).

- **`radius`**: The size of the circle.

- **`extent`**: The angle to sweep (default is 360 degrees).

- **`steps`**: Number of sides for a polygon that approximates a circle (if you want more points, use a higher number).

```python
t1.circle(100, 180)  # Draw a semi-circle with radius 100 (180 degrees)
t1.circle(50, steps=6)  # Draw a hexagon (approximate circle with 6 sides)
```

---

### 5. **`t1.begin_poly()` and `t1.end_poly()`**

These methods allow you to **record** the turtle's movements to create a **polygon**. After `end_poly()`, you can use `t1.get_poly()` to retrieve the recorded points and reuse them.

```python
t1.begin_poly()
for _ in range(5):  # Draw a pentagon
    t1.forward(100)
    t1.left(72)
t1.end_poly()

points = t1.get_poly()  # Store the points of the pentagon
print(points)  # Print the points of the pentagon
```

---

### 6. **`t1.color()` with Multiple Arguments**

You can set the pen **color** and **fill color** separately in one call to `t1.color()`.

```python
t1.color("green", "yellow")  # Pen color is green, fill color is yellow
```

---

### 7. **`t1.speed(speed)`**

The speed method controls how fast the turtle moves. Here’s how it works:

- **`speed(0)`** = **fastest**.

- **`speed(1)`** = **slowest**.

- **`speed(10)`** = **fast**.

You can also use speed names like `'fastest'`, `'normal'`, `'slowest'`.

```python
t1.speed(0)  # Fastest speed (no drawing delay)
```

---

### 8. **`t1.tracer(n)` and `t1.update()`** (Optimizing Drawing)

These methods are great for **faster animations**. `tracer(n)` allows you to specify how many steps to skip before updating the screen, which makes the drawing process much faster. Then, `update()` forces a screen update.

```python
screen.tracer(0)  # Turn off auto-updating
for _ in range(100):
    t1.forward(10)
    t1.left(36)
screen.update()  # Manually update the screen
```

---

### 9. **`t1.clear()`**

Clears everything the turtle has drawn so far, but **does not move** the turtle. This can be used if you want to erase the drawing and start fresh.

```python
t1.clear()  # Clear the screen of all turtle drawings
```

---

### 10. **`t1.reset()`**

Resets the turtle's state completely: clears the screen, returns the turtle to its starting position, and sets the default turtle settings.

```python
t1.reset()  # Resets the turtle to its initial state
```

---

### 11. **`screen.bgcolor(color)`**

This changes the background color of the screen. You can use it to set it to any color you like.

```python
screen.bgcolor("lightblue")  # Set background to light blue
```

---

### 12. **`screen.setup(width, height)`**

This allows you to set the screen size, either by specifying both width and height or as a ratio.

```python
screen.setup(800, 600)  # Set the screen size to 800x600 pixels
```

---

### 13. **`screen.title("Title")`**

This changes the title of the window.

```python
screen.title("My Turtle Program")  # Set window title
```

---

### 14. **`t1.pensize(width)`**

This method allows you to change the width of the turtle's pen.

```python
t1.pensize(5)  # Set pen width to 5
```

---

### 15. **`t1.dot(size, color)`**

This draws a dot at the current turtle position. You can specify the size and color of the dot.

```python
t1.dot(20, "purple")  # Draw a purple dot with size 20
```

---

### 16. **`t1.write(text, move=False, font=("Arial", 12, "normal"))`**

This writes text at the turtle's current position.

```python
t1.write("Hello, Turtle!", font=("Arial", 16, "bold"))  # Write text in bold font
```

---

### 17. **`t1.heading()`**

This returns the current heading (direction) of the turtle in degrees.

```python
direction = t1.heading()  # Get the current heading of the turtle
print(direction)
```

---

### 18. **`screen.onkey(function, key)`**

This method allows you to bind a function to a keypress. You can use this for interactive turtle graphics.

```python
def move_up():
    t1.setheading(90)
    t1.forward(50)

screen.onkey(move_up, "Up")  # Bind the move_up function to the Up arrow key
screen.listen()  # Listen for key presses
```

---

### Example: Combining Some Intermediate Methods

Here’s an example that combines several intermediate methods to create something more dynamic:

```python
from turtle import *

screen = Screen()
t1 = Turtle()

screen.bgcolor("lightblue")
t1.shape("turtle")
t1.color("green")

# Start drawing
t1.penup()
t1.goto(-100, 0)
t1.pendown()

# Draw a square with an indigo outline and a yellow fill
t1.color("indigo", "yellow")
t1.begin_fill()

for _ in range(4):
    t1.forward(100)
    t1.left(90)

t1.end_fill()

# Draw a circle with a filled gradient effect
t1.penup()
t1.goto(150, 0)
t1.pendown()

t1.setheading(0)
t1.circle(50)

# Finish
done()
```

These methods will help you do much more **advanced drawing** with Python Turtle and give you the flexibility to control things like turtle movement, color, screen settings, and even keyboard interaction!
